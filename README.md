# glider197
This site is designed to display active glider paths for the Oceancolor group

The webserver must be able to write to the test.kml file in the main directory
although it is likely a good idea to try to relocate that file.

##Setting up a dev location is a bit tricky
  * Need to provide a data directory (../data/) to house the original data that is processed here.
  * KML file requires absolute references to some assets (icon images, KML file)
